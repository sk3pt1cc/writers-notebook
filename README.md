A scratch pad for writers

## Feature Ideas

Will be a simple scratchpad, but have in-text codes that lets the user tag things as Character, Event, etc. Other screens will use these notes and tags to build visualisations, such as character trees, or character sheets.

An example:

You might tag a note as `[;character]` which will tell the system that this note is a character name, or some description. Then you might tag another note as `[;backstoryEvent($characterName)]` which will tell the system that this is a backstory event that should be attached to a character.

When you go to view characters later, you'll see your character there, and be able to see the backstory events attached to them.

The above is a more advanced feature, but at its core the app is simply a notepad with tagging abilities and also `search for notes by date or tag` functionality.
